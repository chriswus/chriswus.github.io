							<h2 class="project-section-title">Design Background</h2>
							<p>A couple of our friends one day talked about how they and their roommates spent so much time figuring out house chores schedule and complete them on time. We thus came up with the idea of "Roomus". Project “Roomus” aims to develop mobile app to help people manage their house living environments. Especially, we target people sharing spaces with others, i.e, roommates. Our goal is to help you (and ourselves!) become a better roommate, and to save you time from unnecessary planning and management issues that could be solved by technology.</p>
							<h2 class="project-section-title">Design Process</h2>
							<h2>UARs and Task Flows</h2>
							<p>There are already some similar products in the App Store to examine how they work and what they do well and what not. </p><!-- Some example apps are shown here:</p>

							(top) Chorma. (middle)Tody. (bottom)Habitica.
-->
							<p> For example, Chorma is an app that helps you manage house chores with housemembers. An example task flow of Chorma is shown above. The task flows shows that Chorma is fairly straight forward in creating, assigning, and managing chores. It has a reward system that allows housemates to earn points  via finishing chores and redeem reward using points earned. This seems to be a useful system to motivate housemates, however the system itself fails flexibility and efficiency of use by uncustomizable group reward, and only allowing Pro users to create individual rewards.</p>
							<p>Tody is a paid app that helps you manage house chores and environment. It succeeds in intuitiveness of use by providing categorizing tasks by areas with a background picture to match the real world, and by using a status bar to indicate how clean the specific area is. Task creation process requires almost no text entry, which is very efficient in house chore creation settings.</p>
							<p>Habitica is a house chorse app that uses gamification to ease the boredom of house chores. As a (warrior?), You could earn "experience" by finishing chores, and redeem weapons and other warrior kits. Users could also chat with housemates who also use the app. The system, however, suffers from granting too much user freedom that user could earn experience by checking the item to mark "done". Obviously a user could just redeem all the kits without doing any chores.</p>
							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<p>Clearly efficiency of use is central: doing house chores could be boring, and even more so creating a house chores to-do list. How to constantly motivate users to do so is hard. A reward system is an idea, but it is a good idea if and only if there are certain degrees of surveilance and more tangible rewards. Gamification is another idea, but it could easily detour the purpose of a house living management app.</p>

							<p class="clearfix">UHS is a health care services in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus which offers primary medical care, health promotion, and health insurance services to students, staffs and faculties. We were consulting for UHS to redesign and improve the quality of their services. </p>
							<h2 class="project-section-title">Design Process</h2>
							<p>Since we are designing for an organization and its service, we want to know how the organization functions, and how the stakeholders interact with each other. Therefore the first step is to figure out the structure and flow of the organization. We conducted interviews, and built affinities diagram, flow, culture model, and services blueprint to help us understand the current problems</p>
							<div class="img col2">
								<img src="assets/projects/UHS/Affinities1.png">
								<img src="assets/projects/UHS/Affinities2.jpg">
							</div>
							<div class="img">
								<img src="assets/projects/UHS/blueprint1.jpg">
							</div>
							<p>From our models and diagrams, we identified the following key issues, questions, and hot ideas:</p>
							<p> Key Issues </p>
							<ul> 
								  <li>Paitents often experience long wait time</li>
								  <li>Patients do not have a clear image of UHS's capability</li>
								  <li>UHS's website does not provide useful information or does not make useful information visible</li>
								  <li>Insurance process is complicated to process</li>
								  <li>Students think UHS is a marginal path to real doctors</li>
								  <li>Students do not have enough source to stay healthy</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Questions</p>
								<ul> 
								  <li>Why do paitents need to repeat their symptoms over and over again?</li>
								  <li>Why don't students consider UHS health insurace?</li>
								  <li>Are the facility complaints about the new or old facility?</li>
								  <li>How many students got to hospital emergency room, bypassing UHS?</li>
								  <li>Is UHS's role more like an "Urgent Care"?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Design Ideas</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Indicate current wait time for students to manage schedule</li>
								  <li>Mobile sign-ins</li>
								  <li>Focus more on urgent care and health promotion</li>
								  <li>Have lectures and guest lectures about health-related topics</li>
								  <li>Establish real-time communication between staffs within UHS</li>
								  <li>Establish communication between nurse practitioner and doctor at UPMC to expedite the process</li>
								  <li>...</li>
								</ul> </p></p>

							<h2>Visioning and Storyboarding</h2>
							<p>The two major problems is the long wait time and incompetence of the UHS due to limited resources provided by University. We proposed a solution to turn UHS into a training facility based on the fact that UPMC as a high competitor currently outperforms UHS in both wait time and facilities. The only advantage UHS has is the quicker access and convenient location. Thus a training program, which helps to train future nurses, doctors, EMTs, and other medical professionals would increase the overall competence of the UHS and reduces its wait time by having more staffs. Here is one example of storyboard:</p>

							View Deliverables
							</span>
							<p></p>
							<p>We did not propose a technical solution based on the fact that the current problem is not merely the poor user experience and difficult user interface of certain products of UHS, but the low value of UHS as a whole.</p>
							<p>During our proposal, UHS staffs confirmed to us that this is in conjunction with their plan to revamp UHS in the future, which is a side fact that our proposal is well supported and plausible.</p>

							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p class="clearfix">Legend of Heroes: Gagharv Trilogy series is one of the well known Japanese Role Playing Game (RPG) series in the late 90s. It has brought fun and joy to me, so I decided to design a visual book for the series to illustrate the storyline.</p>
							<h2>Inspirations and Motivations</h2>
							<p>The stories of Gagharv Trilogy are mainly about gods, religions, and ancient civilizations. People from the stories take journeys to explore the ancient civilizations and fight evils. The mythological theme thus is better suited for a classic design. Along the journeys, players of the series would be gradually exposed to literature, engravings, and songs about the world in the series. fantasy and mythopoeia tone of the series also inspired me to create an illustration book. In addition, as music being one of the most important component of the game and its' civilizations, I decided to structure the content as a sheet music, composed of Prelude, Fugue, Comedy, and Finale.</p>
							<p>Another reason I wanted to design this book is because even though the series is published on PSP, the quality of the English version is not so good that partly made it no popular in the US area. My personal goal is also to spread the stories to other people who might have missed it by mishaps.</p>
							<h2>Design Process</h2>
							<h3>Personas</h3>
							<p>First, I created personas for my book. Who would want to read this book? Fans who are familiar with the games, children who like fantasy books, or just people who enjoy reading short stories during free time, etc.. The design then needs to match the tone of the stories, and fun and easy to read. </p>
							<h3>Layout</h3>
							<p>I sketched layouts of some pages. Since it's a illustration book, graphics would be apparent and complementing the content. Meanwhile, the text should have a centered, clean layout with not too much content. The three primary colors I chose are consonant with the color theme of the three pieces in the series, respectively.</p>
							<div class="img">

							</div>
							<div class="img">
								<img src="assets/projects/Gagharv Trilogy/primary.png", style="width:30%">
							</div>
							<h3>Types and Contents</h3>
							<p>Since the game develops its own world view with records in book, engravings, music, and words of mouth forms, I intend to make my illustration analogous to murals, sheet music, and children book ( because words of mouth come a lot from bedtime stories, elderlies in the series).</p>
							<p>The book cover uses written Japanese Chinese in 小塚 pro pr6n 違い for Japanese characters and Garamond for English characters. I also used Papyrus in Cover and Chapter Cover.</p>
							<p>Most contents are my own translations because there are no good existing related materials in English.</p>

						<div class="sr-only project-description">
							<blockquote class="quote">“Privacy is a value so complex, so entangled in competing and contradictory dimensions, so engorged with various and distinct meanings, that I sometimes despair whether it can be usefully addressed at all.”
							<footer class="quotefooter">Robert C. Post, Three Concepts of Privacy, 89 Geo. L.J. 2087 (2001).</footer></blockquote>
							<p class="clearfix">Long story short, People don't read privacy policies.</p> 
							<p>The problem is, it is so hard to grasp useful information in pages and pages of words that users don't bother reading. And service providers also don't like to put effort in letting users know what they want to commit. How do we make privacy policy readable?</p>
							<h1>Design Process</h1>
							<p>Our goal is to help users read privacy policy efficiently and to help service providers generate privacy policies easily. First we examined a series of privacy policies, including those of Twitter and Facebook.</p>
							<div class="img col2">
								<img src="assets/projects/Pretty Privacy Policy/Twitter1.png">
								<img src="assets/projects/Pretty Privacy Policy/Twitter2.png">
							</div>
							<p>Twitter has a straightforward hierarchy, which is a one-page centered layout with section titles. It did fairly good job trying to reduce text chunks, but still suffers from information overload. Most websites that somewhat incorporate design decisions on their privacy policy use the same layout. Websites with similar designs include:
							<span 
							   class="pseudolink" 
							   onclick="window.open('https://www.quora.com/about/privacy')">
							Quora
							</span>,
							<span 
							   class="pseudolink"

							   class="pseudolink" 
							   onclick="window.open('https://www.airbnb.com/terms')">
							Airbnb (a horrendous example)
							</span>	.</p>
							<div class="img col2">
								<img src="assets/projects/Pretty Privacy Policy/facebook1.png">
								<img src="assets/projects/Pretty Privacy Policy/facebook2.png">
							</div>
							<p>Facebook contains the most visual elements in their privacy policy (Data policy, as their call it) from what our reasearch has found. It contains a graphical image on the top right of the page, and a list of clickable sections on the left, which directs them to the section of the data policy down below, in the second figure. Users could always go back up by clicking "return to top". Every section has a distinct color code. In the second figure, the grayed items on the left are external links to their other policies.</p>
							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<p>We think, from privacy readers' perspective, the reader should be able to select the part they want to get information from, without having to scrolling through the whole privacy policy, which is long in general. It could also incorporate easily navigable design to allow more user control and freedoms. As for services providers, one idea might be to incorporate more visual element in the page to reduce text overflow. In addition, another design idea is to incorporate interaction techniques to privacy policy page so that readers do not only stare at the screen and get lost.</p>
